THE UNREASONABLE EFFECTIVENSS
OF MATHEMATICS IN THE NATURAL
SCIENCES

Eugene Wigner

Mathematics, rightly viewed, possesses not only truth, but supreme beauty cold and
austere, like that of sculpture, without appeal to any part of our weaker nature, without
the gorgeous trappings of painting or music, yet sublimely pure, and capable of a stern
perfection such as only the greatest art can show. The true spirit of delight, the
exaltation, the sense of being more than Man, which is the touchstone of the highest
excellence, is to be found in mathematics as surely as in poetry.

- BERTRAND RUSSELL, Study of Mathematics

There is a story about two friends, who were classmates in high school, talking about their jobs.
One of them became a statistician and was working on population trends. He showed a reprint to his
former classmate. The reprint started, as usual, with the Gaussian distribution and the statistician
explained to his former classmate the meaning of the symbols for the actual population, for the
average population, and so on. His classmate was a bit incredulous and was not quite sure whether
the statistician was pulling his leg. "How can you know that?" was his query. "And what is this
symbol here?" "Oh," said the statistician, "this is pi." "What is that?" "The ratio of the
circumference of the circle to its diameter." "Well, now you are pushing your joke too far," said the

classmate, "surely the popula : sieisce of the circle."
