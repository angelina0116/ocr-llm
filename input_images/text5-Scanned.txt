The physicist is interested in discovering the laws of inanimate nature. In order to understand this
statement, it is necessary to analyze the concept, "law of nature."

The world around us is of baffling complexity and the most obvious fact about it is that we cannot
predict the future. Although the joke attributes only to the optimist the view that the future is
uncertain, the optimist is right.in this case: the future. is unpredictable. It is, as Schrodinger has
remarked, a miracle that in spite of the baffling complexity of the world, certain regularities in the
events could be discovered. One such regularity, discovered by Galileo, is that two rocks, dropped
at the same time from the same height; reach the ground at the same time. The laws of nature are
concerned with such regularities. Galileoâ€™s regularity is a prototype of a large class of regularities.
It is a surprising regularity for three reasons.
